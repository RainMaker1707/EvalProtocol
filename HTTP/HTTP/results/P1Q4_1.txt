3. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
4. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
5. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
6. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
7. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
8. `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
9. `GET /proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
10. `GET /release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
11. `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
12. `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`

14. `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
15. `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`
16. `POST /wr2`

From these URIs, the only one that contains parameters is the last one:

- `GET /pub/?C=N;O=D`
- `GET /pub/?C=M;O=A`
- `GET /pub/?C=S;O=A`
- `GET /pub/?C=D;O=A`

### Analysis of Parameters

1. **`C=N;O=D`**: This parameter likely refers to sorting the directory listing by "Name" in "Descending" order.
2. **`C=M;O=A`**: This parameter likely refers to sorting the directory listing by "Modification date" in "Ascending" order.
3. **`C=S;O=A`**: This parameter likely refers to sorting the directory listing by "Size" in "Ascending" order.
4. **`C=D;O=A`**: This parameter likely refers to sorting the directory listing by "Description" in "Ascending" order.

### Purpose of Parameters

These parameters are typically used to control the sorting order of directory listings on a web server. They allow users to view the contents of a directory in a specific order based on different criteria such as name, modification date, size, or description.

### User Experience Implications

- **Sorting by Name**: Helps users quickly find files or directories when they know the name, especially useful in directories with many entries.
- **Sorting by Modification Date**: Allows users to see the most recently updated files first, which is useful for finding recent changes or updates.
- **Sorting by Size**: Helps users identify large files quickly, which can be useful for managing storage space or finding significant downloads.
- **Sorting by Description**: Provides a way to sort entries based on their descriptions, which can be helpful if descriptive metadata is available and relevant.

These sorting options enhance the user experience by providing flexibility in how directory contents are displayed, making it easier for users to find and manage files according to their needs.
