### Meaning of Each Status Code:

#### 200 OK:
- **Technical Meaning**: The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
- **User Experience**: The user successfully receives the requested resource, such as a web page, file, or other content. The page loads correctly, and the user can interact with the content as expected.

#### 304 Not Modified:
- **Technical Meaning**: The resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers (e.g., `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match`). The server does not return the resource's body.
- **User Experience**: The user's browser will use the cached version of the resource, which can lead to faster load times since the resource doesn't need to be downloaded again. The user experience is seamless, and they won't notice any difference compared to a fresh load.

### Summary:
- **200 OK** indicates successful retrieval of the requested resource, providing a smooth and expected user experience.
- **304 Not Modified** leverages caching to improve performance, ensuring the user gets a faster response by using already downloaded resources.

These status codes are crucial for efficient web browsing, as they help manage resources, reduce server load, and enhance user experience by minimizing unnecessary data transfer.
