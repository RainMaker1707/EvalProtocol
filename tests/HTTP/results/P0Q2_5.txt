     - GET `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - GET `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - GET `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - **Meaning:**
     - The requested resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use the cached version.
   - **User Experience:**
     - The user will see the cached version of the resource, leading to faster load times and reduced bandwidth usage.

### Detailed Explanation of Status Codes

1. **200 OK**
   - **Definition:** The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default.
   - **User Experience:** Users receive the requested resource (webpage, file, etc.) without any errors. This is the ideal scenario for both the user and the server.

2. **304 Not Modified**
   - **Definition:** The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource.
   - **User Experience:** Users will load the resource from their cache, which speeds up the browsing experience and reduces data usage. This is particularly useful for static resources that do not change frequently.

### Summary in Terms of User Experience

- **200 OK:** The user gets the requested content, resulting in a seamless and smooth experience.
- **304 Not Modified:** The user gets the content from their cache, leading to faster load times and a more efficient browsing experience.

In both cases, the user experience is positive as the requested resources are delivered effectively, either directly from the server or from the local cache.
