Based on the provided CSV file content, let's analyze the HTTP traffic to answer your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?
The data queried by the HTTP protocol include:

- Directory listings and HTML pages:
  - `/pub/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`

- Specific files:
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

### 2. Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?
The browsing behavior appears to be consistent with someone navigating through an FTP server's HTTP interface, looking at directory listings, and downloading specific files. The sequence of requests shows:

- Accessing directory listings, which is typical when browsing an FTP server.
- Downloading specific files from the directories, such as tar.gz files, which are common for software distributions.

### 3. Are the methods used correctly?
The HTTP methods used in the requests are:

- `GET`: This method is used to request data from a specified resource. It is appropriate for retrieving directory listings and downloading files. All the requests in the provided data use the `GET` method, which is correct for the actions being performed (browsing directories and downloading files).

### Summary
- **Data Queried**: Directory listings, HTML pages, and specific file downloads.
- **Legit Browsing Behavior**: Yes, the pattern of accessing directories and downloading files appears to be legitimate browsing behavior for an FTP server.
- **Methods Used Correctly**: Yes, the `GET` method is correctly used for retrieving data and downloading files.
