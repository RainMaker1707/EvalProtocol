### Summary of HTTP Packets

#### HTTP Requests
1. **GET Requests**:
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

2. **POST Requests**:
   - `/wr2`

#### HTTP Responses
- Majority of the responses are `200 OK`, indicating successful retrieval of requested resources.
- Some responses are `304 Not Modified`, indicating that the requested resource has not been modified since the last request.
- The content types include `text/html`, `application/octet-stream`, `application/x-gzip`, and `application/ocsp-response`.

### Analysis

#### Data Queried by HTTP Protocol
- The data being queried includes:
  - Directory listings and files from FTP servers, specifically related to OpenSSL distributions and snapshots.
  - Metadata and release information for Ubuntu distributions (e.g., `InRelease` files).
  - An OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request and response (`/wr2`).

#### Browsing Behavior
- **Legit Browsing Behavior**:
  - The browsing behavior appears to be related to accessing and downloading open-source software distributions and updates, which is common for software development and maintenance tasks.
  - The requests to `/ubuntu/dists/...` and `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/...` directories suggest activities related to package management and software updates.

#### Method Usage
- **GET Method**:
  - Appropriately used for retrieving resources such as directory listings, files, and metadata.
  - Consistent with standard web browsing and file downloading practices.

- **POST Method**:
  - The POST request to `/wr2` is less common in typical browsing scenarios and might be related to a specific application or service interaction, such as submitting data to a server or performing a certificate status check.

### Conclusion
- **Legit Browsing Behavior**: The HTTP requests mostly involve retrieving open-source software and updates, which aligns with legitimate activities for software development and maintenance.
- **Correct Method Usage**: The HTTP methods used (GET and POST) are appropriate for the types of requests being made. The GET requests are used for retrieving resources, and the POST request is likely for submitting data or performing a specific action.

Overall, the HTTP traffic appears to be legitimate and consistent with standard software development and maintenance activities.
