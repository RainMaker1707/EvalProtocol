### Analysis:

1. **Data Queried by HTTP Protocol:**
   - The data queried includes directory listings, file details, and specific files (e.g., tar.gz files) from various directories related to OpenSSL and some Ubuntu distribution files.

2. **Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior:**
   - The browsing behavior appears to be focused on accessing and downloading files related to OpenSSL and Ubuntu distributions, which could be legitimate activities for a developer or system administrator.
   - The presence of Debian APT-HTTP requests suggests that the user might be updating or installing software packages on a Debian-based system.

3. **Correctness of HTTP Methods Used:**
   - The HTTP methods used (GET and POST) are appropriate for the actions being performed:
     - **GET** requests are used to retrieve directory listings, file details, and specific files.
     - **POST** request is used for submitting data to the server (e.g., OCSP request).

### Conclusion:
The HTTP packets in the network flow indicate a user accessing and downloading resources from OpenSSL and Ubuntu repositories, which can be considered legitimate browsing behavior for someone involved in software development or system administration. The HTTP methods used are appropriate for the actions performed.
