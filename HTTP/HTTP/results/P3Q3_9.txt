Based on the provided CSV content, here is a summary of the HTTP packets in the network flow from the worker:

### Data Queried by the HTTP Protocol
1. **GET Requests:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

2. **POST Requests:**
   - `/wr2` (with `application/ocsp-request` content type)

### Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior
The browsing behavior appears to be focused on accessing and downloading resources from various directories on an FTP server, specifically related to OpenSSL, and checking for updates from Ubuntu repositories. This type of activity is common for someone involved in:
- Software development or maintenance, especially dealing with cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL.
- System administration tasks, such as updating and maintaining software packages.

There is no indication of accessing non-work-related websites or services based on the provided data.

### Correctness of the Methods Used
- **GET Method:** The GET requests are used to retrieve resources from the server. This is the appropriate method for accessing files, directories, and other resources that do not change the state of the server.
- **POST Method:** The POST request to `/wr2` with an `application/ocsp-request` content type is used for submitting data to be processed to the specified resource. This is typically used in Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests, which is appropriate for checking the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate.

### Summary
- **Data Queried:** The worker queried various directories and files related to OpenSSL and Ubuntu repositories.
- **Legitimacy:** The browsing behavior seems legitimate and work-related, focusing on software development/maintenance and system administration tasks.
- **Methods Used:** The methods (GET and POST) are used correctly according to their intended purposes in the HTTP protocol.

Overall, the network activity appears to be consistent with professional tasks and does not indicate any misuse or non-work-related browsing.
