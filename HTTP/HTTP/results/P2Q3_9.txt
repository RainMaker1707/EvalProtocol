### Summary of HTTP Packets

#### Queried Data
The HTTP packets show multiple GET requests to an FTP server, specifically to directories and files related to OpenSSL. The queried URIs include:

1. `/pub/`
2. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
3. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
4. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
5. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
6. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
7. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
8. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`

Additionally, there are some GET requests related to Ubuntu package repositories, such as:

1. `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
2. `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
3. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
4. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
5. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
6. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
7. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

There is also a POST request to `/wr2`, which seems to be related to OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) requests.

#### Browsing Behavior
The browsing behavior appears to be focused on accessing and possibly downloading OpenSSL-related files and checking Ubuntu repositories for package updates. This kind of behavior is typical for someone involved in system administration, software development, or IT security:

- **OpenSSL**: Accessing various directories and downloading snapshot tarballs.
- **Ubuntu Repositories**: Checking for updates and release information.

#### HTTP Methods Used
The HTTP methods used in the captured traffic are:

1. **GET**: This method is used to request data from a specified resource. It is correctly used for downloading files and accessing directories.
2. **POST**: This method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is correctly used for OCSP requests.

### Summary
- **Queried Data**: The data queried includes directories and files related to OpenSSL and Ubuntu package repositories.
- **Browsing Behavior**: The browsing behavior seems legitimate and aligns with activities typical of a system administrator or developer.
- **HTTP Methods**: The methods used (`GET` and `POST`) are appropriate for the types of requests being made.

Overall, the browsing behavior and the HTTP methods used appear to be legitimate and correctly implemented.
