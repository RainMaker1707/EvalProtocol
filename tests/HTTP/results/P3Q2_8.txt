     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
     - `/wr2`
   - **Meaning:** The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
   - **User Experience:** The user sees the expected content without any issues.

2. **304 Not Modified**
   - **Requests:**
     - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - **Meaning:** The requested resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use the cached version.
   - **User Experience:** The user sees the content quickly as it is loaded from the cache, improving load times.

#### Explanation of Status Codes

1. **200 OK:**
   - **Description:** This status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The information returned with the response depends on the method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST).
   - **User Experience:** The user successfully receives the requested content, such as a webpage, file, or data. There are no errors or issues, and the content is displayed as expected.

2. **304 Not Modified:**
   - **Description:** This status code indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers (e.g., `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match`). The server does not return any content with this response.
   - **User Experience:** The user benefits from faster load times because the browser uses the cached version of the resource instead of downloading it again from the server. This is particularly useful for static resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets.

### Summary

- **200 OK** indicates successful requests where the server has delivered the requested content.
- **304 Not Modified** indicates that the requested resource has not changed, allowing the client to use a cached version, thereby improving load times.

In terms of user experience, both status codes contribute to a seamless and efficient browsing experience, with **200 OK** ensuring content is available and **304 Not Modified** enhancing performance by leveraging cached resources.
