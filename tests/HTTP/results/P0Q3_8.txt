Based on the provided CSV content, here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?

The HTTP protocol queries a variety of resources, primarily related to directories and files on an FTP server. Here are the specific resources queried:

- Directories:
  - `/pub/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

- Files:
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

### 2. Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?

The browsing behavior appears to be legitimate for someone accessing an FTP server that hosts various open-source software distributions. The user is navigating through directories and downloading files, which is typical behavior for someone looking to download software packages or updates. The presence of user-agent strings like `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0` also suggests that these requests are coming from a web browser, which is consistent with normal browsing activity.

### 3. Are the methods used correctly?

Yes, the methods used are appropriate for the actions being performed:

- **GET**: This method is used to request data from the server. It is correctly used for:
  - Accessing directories (e.g., `/pub/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`)
  - Downloading files (e.g., `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`)

- **POST**: This method is used for submitting data to the server. In the provided data, there is one POST request:
  - `POST /wr2`: This is less clear without additional context, but it appears to be submitting some form of data. The content type is `application/ocsp-request`, which is related to Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests. This could be legitimate depending on the context of the application.

Overall, the methods used align with standard HTTP operations for browsing and downloading files from an FTP server.
