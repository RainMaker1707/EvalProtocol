Based on the provided CSV data, let's analyze the HTTP traffic to answer your questions:

### Queried Data by HTTP Protocol:

1. **GET Requests:**
   - **/pub/**: Accessing the main directory.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/**: Accessing subdirectories and files within the OpenSSL directory.
   - **/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease**: Accessing a specific release file.
   - **/release/dists/jammy/InRelease**: Another specific release file.
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease**: Accessing Ubuntu distribution files.
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease**: Security updates for Ubuntu distribution.
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease**: Updates for Ubuntu distribution.
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease**: Backports for Ubuntu distribution.
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e**: Specific hash file for updates.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/**: Accessing source files for OpenSSL.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz**: Downloading a specific OpenSSL tar.gz file.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README**: Accessing the README file.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message**: Accessing a message file.
   - **/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz**: Downloading a snapshot tar.gz file.

2. **POST Requests:**
   - **/wr2**: This POST request seems to be related to an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request, indicated by the content type `application/ocsp-request`.

### Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior:

- The browsing behavior appears to be legitimate for a user who is accessing and downloading files from an FTP server, specifically related to OpenSSL and Ubuntu distributions. The user is navigating through directories, accessing README files, and downloading specific tar.gz files.
- The OCSP request is also a standard behavior for checking the revocation status of an SSL certificate, which is common during HTTPS communications.

### Method Usage:

- The **GET** method is correctly used for retrieving data from the server, such as directory listings, files, and README content.
- The **POST** method is correctly used for sending data to the server, such as the OCSP request, which is a common use case for POST.

### Summary:

1. **Queried Data by HTTP Protocol:**
   - Directory listings, specific files (e.g., tar.gz, README), and OCSP requests.

2. **Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior:**
   - The browsing behavior seems legitimate for a user accessing an FTP server for OpenSSL and Ubuntu distribution files.

3. **Method Usage:**
   - The methods used (GET for retrieval, POST for OCSP request) are appropriate and correctly applied.

Overall, the HTTP traffic captured in the CSV file indicates a user browsing and downloading files from an FTP server, with no apparent malicious or suspicious activity.
