### Extracted URIs with Parameters:
1. `/?C=N;O=D`
2. `/?C=M;O=A`
3. `/?C=S;O=A`
4. `/?C=D;O=A`
5. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

### Analysis:

1. **URI: `/?C=N;O=D`**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `C=N`: This parameter likely stands for "Column=Name," indicating that the directory listing should be sorted by name.
     - `O=D`: This parameter likely stands for "Order=Descending," indicating that the sorting order should be descending.
   - **Use:** These parameters are typically used in directory listing pages to sort the files or directories by name in descending order.
   - **User Experience:** The user will see the files or directories sorted by their names in descending order, making it easier to find files that are alphabetically last.

2. **URI: `/?C=M;O=A`**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `C=M`: This parameter likely stands for "Column=Modified," indicating that the directory listing should be sorted by the last modified date.
     - `O=A`: This parameter likely stands for "Order=Ascending," indicating that the sorting order should be ascending.
   - **Use:** These parameters are used to sort files or directories by their last modified date in ascending order.
   - **User Experience:** The user will see the most recently modified files or directories at the bottom of the list, which can help in identifying the oldest files first.

3. **URI: `/?C=S;O=A`**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `C=S`: This parameter likely stands for "Column=Size," indicating that the directory listing should be sorted by file size.
     - `O=A`: This parameter likely stands for "Order=Ascending," indicating that the sorting order should be ascending.
   - **Use:** These parameters are used to sort files or directories by their size in ascending order.
   - **User Experience:** The user will see the smallest files or directories first, which can be useful for quickly identifying small files.

4. **URI: `/?C=D;O=A`**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `C=D`: This parameter likely stands for "Column=Description," indicating that the directory listing should be sorted by description.
     - `O=A`: This parameter likely stands for "Order=Ascending," indicating that the sorting order should be ascending.
   - **Use:** These parameters are used to sort files or directories by their description in ascending order.
   - **User Experience:** The user will see files or directories sorted by their description, which can help in finding files based on their descriptive names.

5. **URI: `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`**
   - **Parameters:**
     - This URI contains a hash value (`ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`) which is likely used for verifying the integrity of files.
   - **Use:** This hash parameter is used to ensure that the file being requested has not been tampered with, by matching the hash of the downloaded file with the hash provided in the URI.
   - **User Experience:** The user experience is improved by ensuring the security and integrity of the files being downloaded, as any tampering or corruption of the file would be detected.

### Conclusion:
The parameters in the URIs are primarily used for sorting directory listings by different criteria (name, modified date, size, description) and for ensuring file integrity using hash values. These parameters enhance the user experience by providing sorted views of directories, making it easier to locate files and ensuring the security of downloaded files.
