#### Meaning of Each Status Code
- **200 (OK)**
  - **Meaning:** The request has succeeded. The meaning of success depends on the HTTP method:
    - `GET`: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
    - `HEAD`: The entity headers are in the message body.
    - `POST`: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
    - `TRACE`: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
  - **User Experience:** The user receives the requested resource (e.g., a webpage, file, or other data). This is the most common and expected status code when things are working correctly.

- **304 (Not Modified)**
  - **Meaning:** There is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource. This response is used for caching purposes.
  - **User Experience:** The user's browser or client can use the cached version of the resource, leading to faster load times and reduced data usage, as no new data needs to be downloaded.

### User Experience Implications
- **200 (OK):** 
  - The user successfully receives the requested data or webpage. The experience is smooth as the server has successfully processed the request and provided the necessary information.

- **304 (Not Modified):**
  - The user does not notice any difference because the browser uses the cached version of the resource. This results in faster load times and a more efficient use of network resources, enhancing the overall user experience by reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

In summary, both status codes indicate successful interactions between the client and the server. The `200` status code means the resource is successfully delivered, while the `304` status code leverages caching to optimize performance and resource usage.
