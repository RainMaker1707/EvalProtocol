Based on the provided CSV data, let's analyze the HTTP-related traffic to answer your questions:

### Data Queried by the HTTP Protocol
The following data was queried using the HTTP protocol:

1. **GET Requests:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
   - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

2. **POST Request:**
   - `/wr2` with data `0R0P0N0L0J0`

### Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior
The browsing behavior appears legitimate based on the following observations:

1. **Accessing Repositories and Directories:**
   - The majority of the GET requests are for directories and files within the `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/` path, which suggests browsing through an FTP server's directory structure.
   - Requests for various `InRelease` files under different distributions (e.g., `jammy`, `jammy-security`, `jammy-updates`, etc.) are consistent with the behavior of a package manager (like `apt`) fetching metadata.

2. **File Downloads:**
   - Requests for specific tar.gz files (like `openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`) indicate downloading of software packages, which is typical behavior for users or automated scripts updating or installing software.

3. **User Agent:**
   - The User-Agent string `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0` is consistent across requests, indicating usage of Firefox on a Linux machine.

### Correctness of Methods Used
The methods used in the HTTP requests seem appropriate:

1. **GET Method:**
   - Used for retrieving resources (directories, files, metadata) which is the standard and correct usage of the GET method.
   
2. **POST Method:**
   - The POST request to `/wr2` with data `0R0P0N0L0J0` is less clear without additional context. POST is typically used for submitting data to be processed, so if this endpoint is designed to handle such data, the method is correct. However, without knowing the specific application logic, it's hard to definitively assess the appropriateness of this particular POST request.

### Summary
- **Data Queried:** Various directories and files, primarily from an FTP server and package repositories.
- **Legitimacy:** The browsing behavior seems legitimate, consistent with typical use cases like browsing an FTP server and fetching package metadata.
- **Correctness of Methods:** The methods used (GET and POST) are appropriate for the actions performed, though the specific POST request's legitimacy depends on the context of the endpoint `/wr2`.
