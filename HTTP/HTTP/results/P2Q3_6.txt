     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive
   - **/release/dists/jammy/InRelease**
     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease**
     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive

     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease**
     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive
   - **/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e**
     - User-Agent: Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive

### Analysis:

1. **Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?**
   - The data queried includes directories and files from an FTP server (ftp.openssl.org), specifically within the `/pub/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`, and `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/` directories.
   - There are also queries for Debian package lists and updates, including InRelease files and specific package hashes from various repositories.

2. **Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?**
   - Yes, the browsing behavior seems legitimate for a user who might be involved in software development or system administration. The user appears to be browsing directories and files related to OpenSSL, which is a well-known library for secure communications. Additionally, the APT-HTTP requests suggest that the user is updating or installing software packages on a Debian-based Linux system.

3. **Is the method used correctly?**
   - Yes, the methods used are appropriate for the actions being performed:
     - **GET** requests are used to retrieve files and directories, which is the correct method for such operations.
     - **POST** request is used for an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request, which is also appropriate as POST is commonly used for submitting data to be processed.

Overall, the HTTP traffic captured in this snippet appears to be consistent with legitimate and proper usage of the HTTP protocol for software development and system maintenance activities.
