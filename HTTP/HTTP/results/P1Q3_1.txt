Based on the provided CSV content, here are the answers to your questions:

### Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?

The data queried by the HTTP protocol in the provided CSV content include:

1. **Directory Listings:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

2. **Specific Files:**
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

3. **APT Repository Data:**
   - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

### Does it seem legit browsing behavior?

Yes, the browsing behavior appears to be legitimate. The HTTP requests are consistent with typical activities such as:

1. **Browsing Directory Listings:**
   - Requests for directory listings and specific files from the `ftp.openssl.org` directory are common actions when users or automated scripts are looking for specific versions of software or updates.

2. **Fetching APT Repository Data:**
   - Requests to the `dists/jammy` paths are typical of systems using the Debian APT package manager to update or install software packages. These requests are part of the process to fetch metadata about available packages.

### Does the method used correctly?

Yes, the methods used in the HTTP requests are correct:

1. **GET Requests:**
   - The majority of the requests are `GET` requests, which are appropriate for retrieving data from the server, such as directory listings and specific files.

2. **POST Request:**
   - There is one `POST` request to `/wr2`, which appears to be an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request based on the `application/ocsp-request` content type. This is also a valid use of the `POST` method for submitting data to the server.

### Summary

- **Queried Data:** Directory listings and specific files from `ftp.openssl.org`, and APT repository metadata.
- **Legitimacy:** The browsing behavior appears legitimate and consistent with typical usage patterns.
- **Method Usage:** The HTTP methods (`GET` and `POST`) are used correctly for their intended purposes.
