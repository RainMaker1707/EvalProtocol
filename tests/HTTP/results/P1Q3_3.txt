### Analysis of HTTP Data Queries and Browsing Behavior

#### 1. **Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?**

Based on the provided CSV content, the following resources were queried via the HTTP protocol:

1. **Directories and Index Pages:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

2. **Files:**
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

3. **Other:**
   - `/wr2` (with `POST` method, possibly related to an OCSP request)
   - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

#### 2. **Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?**

The browsing behavior appears to be primarily focused on accessing directory listings and downloading files from an FTP server, specifically related to OpenSSL. Additionally, there are requests related to Debian/Ubuntu package management (`InRelease` files).

- **Legit Aspects:**
  - **Directory Listings:** Accessing directory listings (e.g., `/pub/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`) is common when browsing an FTP server or a web server hosting open-source software.
  - **File Downloads:** Downloading specific tar.gz files (e.g., `openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`) is typical behavior for users looking to obtain software packages.
  - **Package Management:** Requests for `InRelease` files are consistent with the behavior of a system performing updates via APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is standard for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.

- **Suspicious Aspects:**
  - **High Frequency:** If these requests were made in a very short time frame, it could indicate automated behavior rather than manual browsing.
  - **OCSP Request:** The `POST` request to `/wr2` with `application/ocsp-request` and the corresponding `application/ocsp-response` might be related to certificate validation, which is less common in standard browsing but not inherently suspicious.

Overall, the behavior seems consistent with a user or an automated system interacting with an FTP server to download software and a system performing package updates.

#### 3. **Does the method used correctly?**

- **GET Requests:**
  - The majority of the requests are `GET` requests, which are appropriate for retrieving resources like web pages and files.
  - Examples include:
    - `GET /pub/`
    - `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
    - `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`

- **POST Requests:**
  - There is one `POST` request to `/wr2`, which is used to submit data to the server. This request is associated with an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request, which is a legitimate use of the `POST` method for submitting certificate validation requests.

In summary, the methods used (`GET` and `POST`) are appropriate for the types of requests being made.

### Conclusion

1. **Data Queried:** The data queried includes directory listings, specific files related to OpenSSL, and package management files.
2. **Browsing Behavior:** The browsing behavior appears to be legitimate, consistent with accessing an FTP server for software downloads and a system performing package updates.
3. **Method Usage:** The methods (`GET` and `POST`) are used correctly for the types of operations being performed.
