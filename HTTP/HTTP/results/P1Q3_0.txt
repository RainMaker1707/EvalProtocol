Based on the provided CSV content capturing HTTP traffic, let's address each of your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?

The CSV content shows various HTTP GET requests to a server, primarily targeting directories and files related to OpenSSL. Here are the main data queried:

1. **Directories:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

2. **Files:**
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`

3. **Other HTTP Requests:**
   - Various GET requests to `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/` and its subdirectories.
   - A POST request to `/wr2`.

### 2. Does it seem like legitimate browsing behavior?

The browsing behavior appears to be legitimate for the following reasons:

- **Consistent User-Agent:** The User-Agent string `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0` is consistent across the requests, indicating that the requests are likely coming from the same browser session.
- **Nature of Requests:** The requests are primarily targeting directories and files related to OpenSSL, which is common for users or automated scripts downloading or checking for updates on open-source software repositories.
- **APT Requests:** The presence of `Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (2.4.11) non-interactive` User-Agent indicates automated package management activities, which is typical for systems updating their software packages.

### 3. Does the method used correctly?

Yes, the methods used in the HTTP requests are appropriate for their intended actions:

- **GET Method:** Used for retrieving resources such as directories and files. This is the correct method for fetching resources without modifying them.
- **POST Method:** Used in one instance to `/wr2`, which is typically used for sending data to the server. Without further context on what `/wr2` is, it's hard to determine the exact nature of this request, but POST is generally used for such purposes.

### Summary

- **Queried Data:** Mainly directories and files related to OpenSSL, along with some APT package management requests.
- **Legitimacy:** The browsing behavior seems legitimate, consistent with software updates or repository browsing.
- **Methods:** The HTTP methods used are appropriate for the actions performed.
