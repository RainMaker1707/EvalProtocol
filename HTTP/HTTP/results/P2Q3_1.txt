Based on the provided CSV content, here is a summary of the HTTP packets in the network:

### Queried Data by HTTP Protocol:
1. **Directory Listings and HTML Pages:**
   - `/pub/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`

2. **File Downloads:**
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`

3. **Debian APT-HTTP Requests:**
   - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

4. **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Requests:**
   - `/wr2`

### Legit Browsing Behavior:
The browsing behavior seems to be consistent with someone who is:
- Browsing FTP directories and listing their contents.
- Downloading specific files, likely related to OpenSSL.
- Making APT-HTTP requests which are typical for package management on Debian-based systems.
- Performing OCSP requests, which are common for checking the revocation status of digital certificates.

### Methods Used:
- **GET Method:** Used correctly for retrieving directory listings, HTML pages, and downloading files.
- **POST Method:** Used for the OCSP request, which is appropriate for submitting data to the server.

### Conclusion:
- **Queried Data:** Includes directory listings, file downloads, APT-HTTP package management, and OCSP requests.
- **Legit Browsing Behavior:** The activities appear to be legitimate and consistent with typical usage patterns for someone dealing with software repositories, package management, and digital certificates.
- **Methods Used Correctly:** Yes, the methods (GET and POST) are used correctly for their intended purposes in the HTTP protocol.
