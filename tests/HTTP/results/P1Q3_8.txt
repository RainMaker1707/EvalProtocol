Based on the provided CSV file content, let's analyze the HTTP traffic to answer your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?
The HTTP requests in the CSV file indicate that the user is querying various directories and files on an FTP server, specifically related to OpenSSL distributions. Here are the specific resources queried:

- `/pub/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

### 2. Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?
The browsing behavior seems legitimate and consistent with someone exploring and downloading files from an FTP server hosting OpenSSL distributions. The sequence of requests shows typical browsing patterns:

- Initial directory listings (e.g., `/pub/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`)
- Navigation into specific subdirectories (e.g., `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`)
- Downloading specific files (e.g., `openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`, `openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`)
- Viewing README and informational files (e.g., `README`, `.message`)

### 3. Are the methods used correctly?
The methods used in the HTTP requests are primarily `GET`, which is appropriate for the actions being performed:

- **GET**: This method is used for retrieving data from the server. It is correctly used here to fetch directory listings and download files.

There are no other HTTP methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` in the provided data, which aligns with the expected behavior for browsing and downloading files from an FTP server.

### Summary:
- **Queried Data**: The user is querying directories and files related to OpenSSL distributions on an FTP server.
- **Legit Browsing Behavior**: The behavior appears legitimate and consistent with exploring and downloading files from an FTP server.
- **Correct Method Usage**: The `GET` method is correctly used for retrieving directory listings and downloading files.

Overall, the HTTP traffic in the CSV file indicates normal and legitimate browsing behavior on an FTP server hosting OpenSSL distributions.
