Let's analyze the provided CSV content and extract the URIs and their parameters to understand their purpose and implications on user experience.

1. **Extracted URIs with Parameters:**

    - `/pub/?C=N;O=D`
    - `/pub/?C=M;O=A`
    - `/pub/?C=S;O=A`
    - `/pub/?C=D;O=A`

2. **Parameters and Their Meanings:**
    - `C` and `O` parameters are commonly used in directory listing contexts, especially on FTP servers or HTTP servers that serve directory indexes. Here's what they likely refer to:
        - `C`: Column to sort by.
        - `O`: Order of sorting.

    - The specific values:
        - `C=N;O=D`: Sort by Name in Descending order.
        - `C=M;O=A`: Sort by Last modified date in Ascending order.
        - `C=S;O=A`: Sort by Size in Ascending order.
        - `C=D;O=A`: Sort by Description in Ascending order.

3. **Usage of These Parameters:**
    - These parameters are used to control how the directory listing is displayed to the user. They allow the user to sort the files and directories based on different criteria such as name, modification date, size, and description.

4. **Implications on User Experience:**
    - **Enhanced Navigation:** These parameters provide users with the ability to sort and organize the directory contents according to their preferences, making it easier to find specific files.
    - **Customization:** Users can customize their view, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large directories with many files.
    - **Efficiency:** Sorting by different criteria can help users quickly locate the most relevant or recent files, improving the overall efficiency of file browsing.

In summary, the parameters in the URIs are used to sort directory listings on a server. They enhance user experience by providing flexibility and customization in how directory contents are viewed and navigated.
