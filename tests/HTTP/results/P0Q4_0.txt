From the provided CSV content, we can extract the URIs and identify any parameters present in them. Here are the URIs with parameters that can be identified:

1. `/?C=N;O=D`
2. `/?C=M;O=A`
3. `/?C=S;O=A`
4. `/?C=D;O=A`

### Parameters in URIs and Their Meanings:

1. **`C=N;O=D`**:
   - **Parameter `C=N`**: This likely indicates that the content should be sorted by name.
   - **Parameter `O=D`**: This likely indicates that the sorting order should be descending.
   
2. **`C=M;O=A`**:
   - **Parameter `C=M`**: This likely indicates that the content should be sorted by the last modified date.
   - **Parameter `O=A`**: This likely indicates that the sorting order should be ascending.

3. **`C=S;O=A`**:
   - **Parameter `C=S`**: This likely indicates that the content should be sorted by size.
   - **Parameter `O=A`**: This likely indicates that the sorting order should be ascending.

4. **`C=D;O=A`**:
   - **Parameter `C=D`**: This likely indicates that the content should be sorted by description.
   - **Parameter `O=A`**: This likely indicates that the sorting order should be ascending.

### Usage of Parameters:

- **Sorting**: These parameters are used for sorting the directory listing in various ways:
  - By name (`C=N`)
  - By last modified date (`C=M`)
  - By size (`C=S`)
  - By description (`C=D`)
  
- **Order**: The order parameter (`O`) specifies the sorting direction:
  - Ascending (`O=A`)
  - Descending (`O=D`)

### Impact on User Experience:

- **Customizable Views**: These parameters provide users with the ability to customize how they view the directory listing. Users can sort the files and directories based on their preferences, which can make it easier to find specific files.
- **Improved Navigation**: By sorting files in a specific order (e.g., by date or size), users can quickly identify the most recent or largest files, improving their navigation experience.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Offering sorting options enhances the usability of the website or FTP server, as users have more control over how data is presented to them.

In summary, these parameters allow users to sort directory listings in various ways, enhancing their browsing and navigation experience by making it easier to locate and manage files.
