     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz
   - Meaning: The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested resource.
   - User Experience: The user successfully receives the requested web page or file.

2. **304 Not Modified**

     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease
   - Meaning: The requested resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use the cached version.
   - User Experience: The user gets the cached version of the resource, resulting in faster load times.

3. **429 Too Many Requests**
   - Requests:
     - GET /pub/
   - Meaning: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
   - User Experience: The user may experience a delay or temporary block from accessing the resource. They might need to wait before making further requests.

### Summary of Status Codes:
- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource. Users experience successful loading of content.
- **304 Not Modified**: The requested resource has not changed since the last request. Users benefit from faster load times due to caching.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has exceeded the number of allowed requests. Users might experience delays or temporary blocks from the server.

In conclusion, the HTTP status codes provide important feedback about the state of the requested resources and directly impact the user experience by indicating successful retrieval, efficient use of cache, or rate limiting.
