The CSV content provided contains the following HTTP status codes and their associated requests:

1. **200 OK**
   - **Requests:**
     - GET /pub/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz
     - GET /proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /release/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message
   - **Meaning:** The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response depends on the method used in the request.
   - **User Experience:** The user successfully receives the requested resource. For example, a web page loads correctly, or a file download starts.

2. **304 Not Modified**
   - **Requests:**
     - GET /proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /release/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease
   - **Meaning:** There is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is a response to a conditional GET request and indicates that the resource has not been modified since the last request.
   - **User Experience:** The userâ€™s browser uses the cached version of the resource, leading to faster load times.

3. **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)**
   - **Requests:**
     - POST /wr2
   - **Meaning:** OCSP is used to determine the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. The response indicates whether the certificate is still valid.
   - **User Experience:** This is typically transparent to the user. It ensures that the SSL/TLS certificates are valid and have not been revoked, contributing to a secure browsing experience.

### Summary of Status Codes in Terms of User Experience

- **200 OK:** The user successfully accesses the requested resources without any issues.
- **304 Not Modified:** The user benefits from faster load times due to the use of cached resources.
- **OCSP Responses:** The user experiences a secure connection without being explicitly aware of the certificate validation process happening in the background.

These status codes indicate that the network traffic involves successful retrieval of resources, efficient use of cached data, and secure connections through certificate validation.
