### Summary of HTTP Packets

#### Data Queried by HTTP Protocol

1. **General Browsing:**
   - The user accessed directories and files on an FTP server, specifically:
     - `/pub/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

2. **Specific Files:**
   - The user downloaded specific files, such as:
     - `openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
     - `openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
     - `README`
     - `.message`

3. **APT Requests:**
   - The user made several APT-related HTTP requests to update package lists:
     - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

4. **OCSP Requests:**
   - There was an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request and response:
     - POST to `/wr2`
     - Response with `application/ocsp-response`

#### Legitimacy of Browsing Behavior

- **Legit Browsing Behavior:**
  - The accessed URLs and directories are common for users who might be downloading open-source software or updates.
  - The APT requests indicate that the user might be updating or installing packages on a Linux system, which is a typical activity for maintaining software.
  - The OCSP request is part of the certificate validation process, which is a normal part of secure browsing.

#### Correctness of HTTP Methods Used

1. **GET Requests:**
   - Used for retrieving resources like directories and files.
   - Examples:
     - `GET /pub/`
     - `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
     - `GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`

2. **POST Request:**
   - Used for the OCSP request, which is appropriate as it involves sending data to the server for certificate validation.
   - Example:
     - `POST /wr2`

### Conclusion

- **Data Queried:** The user queried directories and files related to open-source software, particularly OpenSSL, and performed package updates.
- **Browsing Behavior:** The browsing behavior appears legitimate, consistent with activities like downloading software and updating system packages.
- **HTTP Methods:** The methods used (GET for retrieving resources and POST for OCSP requests) are appropriate and correctly applied.

Overall, the HTTP packets reflect normal and legitimate browsing behavior with correctly used HTTP methods.
