### Analysis of HTTP Data:

Based on the provided CSV content, let's analyze the data to answer your questions.

#### 1. **Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?**

The following URIs were queried via the HTTP protocol:

1. `/pub/`
2. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
3. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
4. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
5. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
6. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
7. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
8. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
9. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
10. `/wr2`
11. `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
12. `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
13. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
14. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
15. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
16. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
17. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

#### 2. **Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?**

To determine if the browsing behavior is legitimate, we need to consider the following points:

- **Browsing Pattern**: The URIs accessed indicate a pattern consistent with browsing an FTP directory structure, particularly for OpenSSL files. This is a common behavior for users or automated systems (like package managers) downloading or checking for updates.
- **User-Agent**: The user agent `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0` is a legitimate browser identifier.
- **Request Methods**: The requests are predominantly `GET` requests, which are typical for browsing and downloading files.
- **Response Codes**: The response codes include `200 OK`, `304 Not Modified`, and `200 OK` for successful requests and `304` indicating that the requested resource has not been modified since the last access, which is normal behavior.

Given these points, the browsing pattern appears to be consistent with legitimate behavior, likely involving a user or an automated system accessing and downloading files from an FTP server.

#### 3. **Is the method used correctly?**

The methods used in the HTTP requests are:

- `GET`: This is the correct method for retrieving resources such as HTML pages, documents, and files. All the `GET` requests are used appropriately to fetch directory listings and download files.
- `POST`: There is one `POST` request to `/wr2`. The `POST` method is typically used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. Without further context on what `/wr2` is meant to handle, it's hard to definitively say if this `POST` request is appropriate. However, the presence of an `application/ocsp-request` suggests it might be related to an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request, which is a legitimate use case.

### Conclusion:

1. **Queried Data**: The data queried includes directory listings and specific files related to OpenSSL, along with some requests to Ubuntu repositories.
2. **Legitimacy**: The browsing behavior seems legitimate, consistent with either a user or an automated system accessing and downloading files from an FTP server.
3. **Method Usage**: The methods used (`GET` and `POST`) are appropriate for the types of requests being made, assuming `/wr2` is meant to handle OCSP requests.

Overall, based on the provided data, there are no immediate red flags indicating illegitimate or malicious behavior.
