Based on the provided CSV file content, we can identify a few URIs with parameters. Here are the details:

1. **URI with Parameters:**
   - `/?C=N;O=D`
   - `/?C=M;O=A`
   - `/?C=S;O=A`
   - `/?C=D;O=A`

2. **Parameters and their usage:**
   - `C`: This parameter likely stands for "Column" or "Criteria" and is used to specify the sorting criterion.
   - `O`: This parameter likely stands for "Order" and specifies the order of sorting.

   The values for these parameters are:
   - `C=N`: Sort by Name.
   - `C=M`: Sort by Last Modified date.
   - `C=S`: Sort by Size.
   - `C=D`: Sort by Description.
   - `O=D`: Order in Descending.
   - `O=A`: Order in Ascending.

3. **User Experience:**
   - These parameters are commonly used in directory listing pages on web servers to provide users with options to sort the displayed files and directories.
   - For example, if a user clicks on a link to sort by name in descending order, the URI might include `/?C=N;O=D`.
   - This enhances the user experience by allowing users to easily organize and find files based on their preferred sorting criteria.

In summary, the parameters in the URIs extracted from the HTTP traffic refer to sorting options for directory listings on a web server. They are used to customize the order in which files and directories are displayed, improving the user's ability to navigate and find specific items.
