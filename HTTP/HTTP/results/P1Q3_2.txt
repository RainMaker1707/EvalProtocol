Based on the provided CSV content, let's analyze the HTTP traffic to answer the questions:

### Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?
The data queried by the HTTP protocol in the provided network sniff are primarily related to the retrieval of directory listings and files from an FTP server, specifically from the `ftp.openssl.org` repository. Here are the main URIs that were accessed:

1. `/pub/`
2. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
3. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
4. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
5. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
6. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
7. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
8. `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`

Additionally, there were some queries related to Debian package updates:
1. `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
2. `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
3. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
4. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
5. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
6. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
7. `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

### Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?
The browsing behavior seems consistent with someone navigating an FTP server to view and download files, particularly related to OpenSSL source distributions and snapshots. The user agent is consistently `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0`, which indicates the use of a web browser on a Linux system.

Additionally, there are requests related to Debian package updates, which is typical behavior for a system performing package management tasks.

### Does the method used correctly?
The methods used in the HTTP requests are as follows:

- **GET**: Used for retrieving resources, such as directory listings and files. This is appropriate for the actions being performed (e.g., viewing directory contents, downloading files).
- **POST**: There is one `POST` request to `/wr2` with `application/ocsp-request`. This is typically related to Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests, which is also a legitimate use of the `POST` method.

Overall, the methods used (GET and POST) are appropriate for the types of actions being performed.

### Conclusion
- **Data Queried**: Directory listings and files from `ftp.openssl.org`, Debian package update metadata.
- **Legit Browsing Behavior**: Yes, the behavior is consistent with legitimate browsing and package management activities.
- **Methods Used Correctly**: Yes, the methods (GET and POST) are used appropriately for the actions being performed.
