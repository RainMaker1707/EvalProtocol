   - Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.
   - URIs:
     - `/pub/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
     - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
     - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
     - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`

2. **POST**:
   - Purpose: The POST method is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
   - URIs:
     - `/wr2`

### Common Combination (Method + URI)
- **GET + URI**: This combination is very common in HTTP traffic as it is used to retrieve resources such as web pages, images, files, etc.
- **POST + URI**: This combination is also common and is typically used for form submissions, uploading files, or sending data to the server.

### User Perspective and Commonality in HTTP Traffic
- **Common HTTP Traffic**: The observed traffic is typical for a user browsing the web and downloading files. The GET requests are used to fetch web pages and resources, while the POST request is likely used for some form of data submission.
- **User Actions**: The user appears to be browsing directories on an FTP server, specifically looking at the contents of `/pub/`, `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`, and its subdirectories. The user also seems to be downloading files such as `openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz` and `openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`.
- **Browsing Activity**: The user browsed various directories and files related to OpenSSL, a popular open-source toolkit for SSL and TLS. The user accessed directory listings and downloaded specific tar.gz files, which are common formats for distributing source code.

### Summary of User Activity
- The user accessed several directories on an FTP server, specifically related to OpenSSL.
- They viewed directory listings and downloaded specific files.
- The traffic pattern is typical for someone browsing and downloading files from an FTP server.

In conclusion, the captured HTTP traffic shows a user engaging in typical browsing and downloading activities on an FTP server, specifically focusing on OpenSSL-related resources.
