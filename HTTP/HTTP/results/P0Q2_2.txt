     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message
     - GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz
   - **Meaning:** The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
   - **User Experience:** The user receives the requested resource (e.g., a webpage, file, or data), and the interaction is smooth and successful.

2. **304 (Not Modified)**
   - **Requests:**

     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease
   - **Meaning:** Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers. The client can use a cached version.
   - **User Experience:** The user does not see any difference because the browser uses the cached version of the resource, leading to faster load times.

3. **304 (Not Modified)**
   - **Requests:**
     - GET /proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease
     - GET /ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease
   - **Meaning:** Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers. The client can use a cached version.
   - **User Experience:** The user does not see any difference because the browser uses the cached version of the resource, leading to faster load times.

4. **200 (OK)**
   - **Requests:**
     - POST /wr2
   - **Meaning:** The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
   - **User Experience:** The user receives the requested resource (e.g., a webpage, file, or data), and the interaction is smooth and successful.

### Meanings of Status Codes

1. **200 (OK)**
   - **Meaning:** The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
   - **User Experience:** The user can see or interact with the requested resource without any issues.

2. **304 (Not Modified)**
   - **Meaning:** The resource has not been modified since the last request. The client should use the cached version of the resource.
   - **User Experience:** The resource loads quickly because the browser uses the cached version, improving performance.

### User Experience Implications

- **200 (OK):** Users experience a smooth interaction where the requested resources (webpages, files, etc.) are delivered as expected. There are no errors, and the content loads successfully.
- **304 (Not Modified):** Users benefit from faster load times because the browser uses cached resources instead of downloading them again. This results in a more efficient and quicker browsing experience.

In summary, the status codes 200 and 304 indicate successful interactions where resources are delivered or efficiently loaded from the cache, leading to a positive user experience.
