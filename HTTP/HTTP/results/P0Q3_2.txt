Based on the provided CSV content, here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?

The HTTP protocol is used to query various resources, primarily related to directory listings and file downloads from an FTP server. The specific data queried include:

- Directory listings:
  - `/pub/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`

- Specific files:
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
  - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
  - Various other OpenSSL snapshot tar.gz files.

### 2. Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?

Yes, the browsing behavior appears to be legitimate. The user is accessing directory listings and downloading files from an FTP server, which is typical behavior for someone looking to download software or check for updates. The user agent string "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0" suggests that a web browser (Firefox) on a Linux system is being used for these operations. This is consistent with normal browsing behavior for downloading open-source software or related files.

### 3. Is the method used correctly?

Yes, the methods used in the HTTP requests are appropriate for the actions being performed:

- **GET** method: This is used to request data from a specified resource. It is correctly used here for accessing directory listings and downloading files. Examples include:
  - `GET /pub/`
  - `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
  - `GET /pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`

- **POST** method: This is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. There is one instance of a POST request:
  - `POST /wr2` with `application/ocsp-request` content type. This seems to be related to an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request, which is also a legitimate use of the POST method.

Overall, the HTTP methods used in the provided data are appropriate and correctly applied for the given operations.
