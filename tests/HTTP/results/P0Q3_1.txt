   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.2-SNAP-20231220.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.1.4.tar.gz`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
   - `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
   - `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
   - `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

2. **POST Request:**
   - `/wr2` (with `application/ocsp-request` content type)

### Legit Browsing Behavior
- The GET requests to various directories and files under `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/` and related paths suggest typical browsing behavior associated with downloading files from an FTP-like directory structure.
- The requests to `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease` and similar paths indicate updating or fetching package lists, which is common for systems using APT (Advanced Package Tool) such as Debian or Ubuntu.
- The POST request to `/wr2` for an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request is also typical for checking the revocation status of a digital certificate.

### Correctness of Methods Used
- **GET Requests:** Used correctly for retrieving resources such as directories, files, and package lists.
- **POST Request:** Used correctly for submitting data to the server, in this case, an OCSP request.

### Conclusion
- **Data Queried:** Various directories and files primarily under `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/` and package lists from `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/`.
- **Legit Browsing Behavior:** Yes, the browsing behavior seems legit as it involves typical activities like downloading files and fetching package lists.
- **Methods Used Correctly:** Yes, the methods (GET and POST) are used correctly according to their intended purposes.
