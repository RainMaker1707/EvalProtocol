Based on the provided CSV content, we can extract and analyze the URIs to identify any parameters and their potential purposes. Here are the URIs with parameters:

1. **`/pub/?C=N;O=D`**
2. **`/pub/?C=M;O=A`**
3. **`/pub/?C=S;O=A`**
4. **`/pub/?C=D;O=A`**

### Parameters and Their Meanings:
- **`C`**: This parameter likely stands for "Column" or "Criteria".
- **`O`**: This parameter likely stands for "Order".

### Usage of Parameters:
- **`C=N;O=D`**: This could be used to sort the directory listing by "Name" in descending order.
- **`C=M;O=A`**: This could be used to sort the directory listing by "Modification time" in ascending order.
- **`C=S;O=A`**: This could be used to sort the directory listing by "Size" in ascending order.
- **`C=D;O=A`**: This could be used to sort the directory listing by "Description" in ascending order.

### User Experience Implications:
- **Sorting Functionality**: The parameters `C` and `O` are used to provide sorting functionality on the directory listing page. This allows users to view the files and directories in a specific order based on their preferences.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: By using these parameters, users can quickly find files based on their names, modification dates, sizes, or descriptions, enhancing the overall navigation experience.
- **Customization**: These parameters offer customization options for users, making it easier to manage and locate files in large directories.

In summary, the parameters found in the URIs are primarily used for sorting the directory listing in various orders, improving user experience by providing sorting and customization options.
