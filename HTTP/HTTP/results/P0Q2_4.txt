### Meaning of Each Status Code

1. **200 OK**
   - **Meaning:** This status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The information returned with the response depends on the method used in the request.
   - **User Experience:** The requested resource (webpage, file, etc.) is successfully retrieved and displayed to the user.

2. **304 Not Modified**
   - **Meaning:** This status code indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match`. In such a case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.
   - **User Experience:** The user will see the cached version of the requested resource because it hasn't changed since the last time it was accessed. This can result in faster load times as no new data needs to be downloaded.

### User Experience Implications

- **200 OK:** The user gets the requested content without any issues. The experience is seamless as the content is delivered successfully.
- **304 Not Modified:** The user benefits from faster load times as the browser or client can use the cached version of the resource. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred and can result in a more responsive experience.
