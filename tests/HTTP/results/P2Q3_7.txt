Based on the provided CSV content, let's address each of your questions:

### 1. Which data are queried by the HTTP protocol?

The HTTP requests in the provided CSV content are primarily querying directories and files on FTP servers, specifically related to the OpenSSL project and some other repositories. Here are the specific data queried:

- `/pub/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/README`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/source/.message`
- `/pub/ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-3.1-SNAP-20231223.tar.gz`
- `/proprietary/dists/jammy/InRelease`
- `/release/dists/jammy/InRelease`
- `/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease`
- `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease`
- `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/InRelease`
- `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-backports/InRelease`
- `/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/universe/cnf/by-hash/SHA256/ae6170bb819201d2fe94763f8171c491f71988cb093b6159632c45c5929f6c1e`

### 2. Does it seem like legit browsing behavior?

The browsing behavior seems focused on accessing and downloading files from public FTP servers, particularly related to OpenSSL and some Linux distribution repositories. This type of activity is common for developers, system administrators, or anyone involved in maintaining or updating software systems. Here are some points that support the legitimacy:

- Accessing OpenSSL snapshots and source files.
- Retrieving files from Linux repositories.
- The user agent indicates a Linux system using Firefox, which aligns with the type of activity observed.

### 3. Are the methods used correctly?

Yes, the methods used are correct for the actions performed. The HTTP methods observed in the CSV content are:

- **GET**: Used for retrieving resources from the server. This is the appropriate method for accessing directories and downloading files.
- **POST**: Used for sending data to the server, observed in a single instance related to an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request.

The HTTP response codes also indicate successful transactions (e.g., 200 OK, 304 Not Modified), which suggests that the methods are being used correctly.

### Summary

- **Queried Data**: The HTTP requests are querying directories and files related to OpenSSL and Linux repositories.
- **Legitimacy**: The browsing behavior appears to be legitimate, likely related to software development or system administration tasks.
- **Correct Methods**: The HTTP methods used (GET and POST) are appropriate for the actions performed.

Overall, the HTTP traffic captured in the CSV content seems to reflect legitimate and correctly executed browsing behavior.
